# TicTacToeV1
A basic TicTacToe project

This is a version of TicTacToe that I hope to return to in about a year or so, perhaps in the pursuit of machine learning!

There are very few unique features to this project - but it does help to cement understanding of directional arrays, and is an introduction to the importance of a coherent front-end being presented to the user.

Firstly, we offer the user the opportunity to choose the size of the grid; from 3*3 - 10*10.

We then ask the user to input their move...

And, the program prints out a grid

We prevent the user from playing a move that has already been entered:

It's essential that the game terminates after the maximum number of moves, with a 'tie game' message if no winner has been found.

We also include appropriate (if identical) winning messages:
